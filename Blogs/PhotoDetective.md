To complete my 'Photo Detective' task, I decided to go with [Zeal Liang's photo submission.](https://media.openlearning.com/wng9UnvShKsmkBJ3i2JpoXzSgAjYgGhouMWoMxiarNyQkUYu3xu8mJsWPhwRttW5.1645084597/_20220217185629-vo9xr89fzx6av33e.jpg)

At first glance, the image is just one of a generic, pretty sunset, with not much to offer otherwise. But, on closer inspection, we can find clues that point towards where the picture was taken.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Observations:</span>

*   Subaru car showroom in the foreground, along with what seems to be service centres for Holden, Nissan and Subaru vehicles, named "Suttons Part Dept."
*   Photo was taken from a point of high elevation (e.g. A tall building/top of a hill, etc.)
*   Seeing a wall on the far left of the photo confirms that it was captured from a building of some sort.
*   Googling "suttons part dept subaru" revealed the location of the showroom.

*   On checking out Google street view, we can notice only 2 tall structures opposite the showrooms. One of them can be eliminated due to limited field of vision in the image.
*   Hence, we can confirm that the photo was taken from

<div class="macro-spoiler">
<p style="text-align:center;">132 Epsom Road, Zetland, NSW 2017</p>
</div>

*   Using its address, the building was then identified to be

"Paragon", designed by Turner Studio.

*   [Further research](https://online2.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/DA/IndividualApplication?tpklapappl=1230300) revealed elevation plans for the building, as it is publicly available information.

*   Looking at Google street view, and comparing it with floor plans and the source image, the photo must have been taken from one of the following units, either from the balcony, or from the window in Bedroom 2 (B2) :

_Reflection:_

*   This exercise has revealed how much information can be gathered from just one photo, information that if used by someone with malicious intent, can be very dangerous.
*   The one image provided was enough to find the unit's location, and layout, both of which are public information, and require no illegal means to get them.
*   Hence, we must be very careful about what we post online, and should always be aware of what information we're putting out there, intentionally or not.
